# Overview

Communications and Technology Management \(CTM\) developed this guidance to help City of Austin departments use electronic and digital signatures in internal and community-facing services during the COVID-19 emergency. In most instances, electronic signatures are legally enforceable, so it's perfectly legal to use these tools. While there is currently no City policy that addresses electronic signatures, the law does not require adoption of a policy in order to use electronic signatures. With your feedback, we'll develop a policy to follow this guidance at a later date. 

No matter what else is going on, offering multiple ways to access services, including online, helps make services more accessible for Austin residents. But during the current COVID-19 emergency, departments need to offer services and transactions online as much as possible. Some departments have already adopted electronic or digital signatures, while others haven’t, yet. CTM aims to support all City departments as they use and process online signatures during the COVID-19 emergency and beyond. 

This guidance outlines: 

* The differences between electronic signatures and digital signatures 
* A breakdown of which type of electronic signature tool supports different types of transactions 
* How to follow laws and organizational policies \(e.g., records retention\) when using these tools 
* How to get advice and help with using electronic and digital signatures

## Intended audience

* Departments that are currently using or accepting electronic signatures as part of their forms or transactions
* Departments that need to use or accept online signatures as part of their forms or transactions, but are not yet using technology to do this

## Goals of this guidance

* Support departments as they use electronic and digital signatures during the COVID-19 emergency. 
* Invite departments to give feedback on a pilot electronic signatures tool during the COVID-19 emergency, and help them with accessing it if they are not yet using one.  
* Enable the City to move more services and transactions online to support social distancing and business efficiency during the COVID-19 emergency. 
* Invite departments that have used digital signatures to share what has and has not worked for them. 

## What this guidance does not do 

* Provide special authority or permissions regarding electronic signatures.  
* Suggest a process that would contradict any state law, ordinance, policy, rule, or procedure.  
* Affect any laws that require paper documents or wet-ink signatures. 
* Prevail over any administrative bulletin.  
* Suggest a process that ignores a department’s local record retention schedule.  

## Contact and questions

Contact CTM if your department is not yet using an electronic signatures tool. CTM is vetting a pilot digital signatures tool with a limited number of subscriptions to offer for other departments in summer 2020. We can also help departments determine the right tool or signature method for their transactions.
