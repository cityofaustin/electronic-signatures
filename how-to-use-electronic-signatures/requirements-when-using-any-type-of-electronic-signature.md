# Requirements when using any type of electronic signature

Regardless of whether you are using a less formal electronic signature or a more formal digital signature, there are several steps you need to take to keep a record of the transaction, maintain the validity of the transaction, and make sure the transaction is accessible for the person signing.

### 1. Determine how you will keep an electronically signed record. 

Review your department’s record retention schedule to determine how long a record must be kept. You still need to comply with this schedule. An electronically signed record must be kept for the same length of time as a paper record signed using a wet-ink signature. If you are using an electronic or digital signatures tool, make sure it can export backups of the signed transactions. 

### 2. Determine what other records you may need to keep with the electronically signed record to provide context. 

More sophisticated digital signature tools have features to verify the identity of the signer, like email verification or sending a code to the signer’s mobile phone. If your tool does not verify the identity of the signer, then determine what other records you need to keep that will provide evidence that the signature is authentic and that the signer intended to sign. The City needs to keep these contextual records with the electronically signed document in case the City needs to prove the authenticity of the signature and the validity of the signed content.  

### 3. For external transactions, get the other party’s agreement to use an electronic or digital signature to sign a document. 

Both parties to a transaction must agree to use electronic signatures or conduct  business by electronic means. A party to the transaction can opt out of using electronic signatures if they want. A person’s agreement to conduct one transaction electronically does not equal that person’s agreement to conduct all transactions electronically. Get all parties’ agreement to use electronic signatures each time, for each transaction. 

Departments can get and document this agreement by:  

* Prompting the user to check a box, type their first and last name, or both, indicating their agreement to do business electronically 
* Asking the other party to send an email that states their agreement  

Talk with your attorney about the appropriate language to include in the agreement. 

If you are using a digital signatures tool, talk with your attorney about how to draft a first-click-agreement appropriate for your transaction. Talk to CTM about how to insert this first agreement into the software you are using. 

### 4. Make sure the other party can receive, print, and store the electronic record. 

If you offer a transaction to be conducted online, make sure that the person has a compatible program or is able to use the program you are using. Make sure they can open and click within a document to create an electronic signature. The tools we use must allow the recipient to print or save the document upon receiving it. To ensure they can, send the recipient an email asking them to let you know if they have problems with opening, clicking, signing, printing, or saving the record. If they have any problems with these, you will have to use a different process.  If no other electronic signature process will work, then you will have to move to a traditional paper and ink process, using regular mail.   

### 5. Ensure the transaction and signature are both accessible, and that you offer multiple ways for residents to access the service or transaction. 

Some electronic signatures are not accessible for all people. For example, people who are blind, have low vision, or a physical disability may not be able to sign their name with their finger or mouse cursor on a web application. Ensure you provide another way for people to sign and conduct the transaction. Contact CTM for advice on how to make the transaction more accessible, or to evaluate the accessibility of specific signature methods. 

Moving to online-only transactions can exclude residents without access to home internet or devices. And as explained above, a person can refuse to conduct business electronically. Departments should provide other ways to conduct transactions, for example using paper and ink, and regular mail.
