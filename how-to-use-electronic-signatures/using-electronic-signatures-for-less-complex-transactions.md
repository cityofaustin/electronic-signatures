# Using electronic signatures for less complex transactions

Less-complex transactions can usually use an “electronic signature” -- a text or a symbol that takes the place of a hand-written signature. 

### Example transactions that can use electronic signatures

* Program registration forms
* Forms to request information or records 
* Timesheets 
* Internal approvals 
* Memos

### Example technologies or methods to use

* Paste a scanned image of a hand-written signature on an electronic document. 
* Print a document, sign it by hand, scan and send it as an electronic file.  
* Use a tool that allows users to draw their signature by hand or cursor \(like on payment tablets at food trucks\).
* Use a check-box on an online form that indicates the user’s intent to sign the document \(internal approvals\). 
* Ask the signer/recipient to send an email representing their approval or agreement with the transaction.

**Electronic signatures are generally not tamper-proof**. These methods don't ensure that the document remains unchanged after it is signed. We can address this with extra documentation. In addition to the signature, ask the signer to send an email that says they intend to sign electronically. This documentation will serve as the audit trail for low-risk transactions.
