# Using basic electronic signatures for less complex transactions

Less complex transactions can usually use a basic electronic signature -- a text or a symbol that takes the place of a hand-written signature. 

### Example transactions that can use basic electronic signatures

* Program registration forms
* Forms to request information or records 
* Time sheets 
* Internal approvals 
* Memos

### Example methods to use

* Use a tool that allows users to draw their signature by hand or cursor, such as on tablets at points of sale.
* Use a check box on an online form that indicates the userâ€™s intent to sign the document. This can often work for internal approvals, and is a more accessible method than drawing a signature by hand or cursor. 
* Ask the signer or recipient to send an email representing their approval or agreement with the transaction.

**Offer multiple signature methods to provide access for all**. Basic electronic signatures can include pasting a scanned image of a hand-written signature on an electronic document, or scanning and sending a document with a hand-written signature. However, these methods are not accessible for people with visual impairments.

**Basic electronic signatures are generally not tamper-proof**. These methods don't ensure that the document remains unchanged after it is signed. We can address this with extra documentation. In addition to the signature, ask the signer to send an email that says they intend to sign electronically. This documentation will serve as the audit trail for low-risk transactions.
