# Which type of electronic signature do you need?

For this guidance, we consider two general types of electronic signatures. Learn about the types and find out which type you need below.

**Basic electronic signatures**: A way to sign something online, but without necessarily verifying the identity of the signer or having an audit trail. These include scanned images of signatures, hand-drawn signatures via the web, and check-boxes on online forms. These are less formal, usually easier and cheaper, but less secureâ€”more appropriate for lower-risk services and transactions. [Read the legal definition.](../definitions.md#electronic-signature)

**Digital signatures**: A type of electronic signature that includes more levels of authentication, verification, audit trails, and security. These are specifically for higher-risk transactions that need more documentation and verification. If your transactions require digital signatures, then using a Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\) vendor such as Adobe Sign or DocuSign might be an option.

### Does your transaction:

* Involve the exchange of money, property rights, or legal rights?
* Generate information that might be subject to audit or compliance?
* Generate information that might be needed as proof in court, for example as part of a dispute by one of the parties to the transaction?
* Involve a law, regulation, or rule that requires a signature on this specific transaction?
* Generally need a high degree of confidence that the person signing is who they say they are, and that the document was not changed or tampered with after signature?
* Include any of these:
  * Contracts    
  * Change orders   
  * Amendments to contracts 
  * Procurement documents \(disclosure of interest forms, certificate of insurance forms, etc.\) 
  * Leases 
  * Easements 
  * License agreements 
  * Donation or deed of gift forms 
  * Event or space rentals 
  * Permit applications and related documents 

**Yes, my transaction involves some or all of these conditions**. Your transaction is more complex, and so you likely need a digital signature tool with more sophisticated features. [Learn how to use digital signatures](using-digital-signatures-for-more-complex-transactions.md).

**No, my transaction does not involve any of these conditions**. Your transaction is less complex, and so you might be able to use a basic electronic signature. [Learn how to use basic electronic signatures](using-electronic-signatures-for-less-complex-transactions.md).
