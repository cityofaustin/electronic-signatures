# Does your transaction need a signature?

If a service or transaction does not require a signature, the simplest solution may be to remove the signature line. The law requires signatures on some services and transactions, particularly those involving third parties such as contracts, leases, or permit applications. These include:

* Contracts
* Transactions and documents listed in the City's policy on signature authority 
* Documents mentioned in the City Code, or in any federal or state law.
* Documents that are important to whether a resident receives City services and could end up in court one day 
* Documents where the person signing is waiving or preserving any rights

**Talk to your department leadership if you have internal or inter-departmental transactions that require signatures.** Departments decide whether or not to collect signatures on many internal documents. If you have an internal document that your department requires another department to sign, you might ask your director whether this document really needs a signature, or whether you can document agreement without a signature, for example, with an email that confirms the other person's approval.
