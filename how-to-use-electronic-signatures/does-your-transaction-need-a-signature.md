# Does your transaction need a signature?

If a service or transaction does not require a signature, the simplest solution may be to remove the requirement for a signature.  Some services and transactions require signatures, particularly those involving third parties such as contracts, leases, or permit applications. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For many services and transactions, including internal or inter-departmental transactions, it is up to a department to decide whether to collect a signature.
