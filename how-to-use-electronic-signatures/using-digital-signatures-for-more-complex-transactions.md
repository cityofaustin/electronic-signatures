# Using digital signatures for more complex transactions

Higher-complexity transactions usually call for a digital signature, a type of electronic signature with added technology that provides the following: 

* Authentication — Verifies the person signing is who they say they are 
* Integrity — Ensures that the document does not change after being signed 
* Audit trail — Keeps a history of all activity on the transaction 

### Example transactions that need digital signatures

* Contracts    
* Change orders   
* Amendments to contracts 
* Procurement documents \(disclosure of interest forms, certificate of insurance forms, etc.\) 
* Leases 
* Easements 
* License agreements 
* Donation or deed of gift forms 
* Event or space rentals 
* Permit applications and related documents 

### Example technologies or methods to use 

There are many digital signature tools on the market, such as DocuSign and Adobe Sign.
