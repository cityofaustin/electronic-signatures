### Federal law

The [Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce \(ESIGN\), 15 U.S. Code Chapter 96](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title15/chapter96&edition=prelim), is the federal law that governs electronic signatures.  

### Texas law and guidance

* [The Uniform Electronic Transaction Act](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.322.htm) \(UETA\), Chapter 322 of the Texas Business & Commerce Code, is the Texas law that governs the use of electronic signatures.   
* Texas Department of Information Resources’ [Guidelines for the Management of Electronic Transactions and Signed Records](http://publishingext.dir.texas.gov/portal/internal/resources/DocumentLibrary/Texas%20Uniform%20Electronic%20Transactions%20Act%20%28UETA%29%20Guidelines.pdf) \(“the Guide”\): While cities are not required to follow the Guide by law, they can use the Guide to evaluate transaction risk and the effectiveness of a given signature method, as well as to formulate plans and procedures to manage electronic records and electronic signatures.  

### City of Austin policy

* Signature Authority: A department’s use of online signatures must comply with City of Austin Administrative Bulletin 03-01 – Delegation of the City Manager’s Signature Authority, which governs which positions have signature authority for different types of transactions.
