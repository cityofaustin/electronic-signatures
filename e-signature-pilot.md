# Access CTM's pilot electronic signature tool

CTM is offering a limited subscription to an electronic signature tool for City departmentsâ€™ use. The pilot tool is part of an existing CTM subscription and is available at likely no-cost to departments.

Departments are not required to use CTM's pilot platform for electronic signatures. Those that have begun using a platform already can continue to do so, along with reviewing the guidance on this site.

In parallel with this pilot phase, CTM is planning for a longer term, citywide signature platform that can serve all departments. Expect more information on this later in 2020.

### How to get set up on the pilot electronic signature tool

#### 1. Make sure you have read this guidance and understand what type of electronic signatures you need for your transactions.

If you have additional questions about the guidance, [contact our team](https://bit.ly/esignature-questions%20). 

#### 2. Submit a [request to the CTM Service Desk](https://atx.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=8d7002addbc74810e2f1121d139619cd&sysparm_category=4cd27231dbae3b805b03f482ba961906). 

Request access to the pilot electronic signature tool with a [ticket to the CTM Service Desk](https://atx.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=8d7002addbc74810e2f1121d139619cd&sysparm_category=4cd27231dbae3b805b03f482ba961906). Check the box next to "Adobe Sign".

What to expect when you submit a request:

* **Cost and billing**: CTM purchased a subscription to this pilot tool that will likely cover most of departments' needs over the next six months with no new costs to departments. We still need to collect your funding code \(FDU\) as part of the request in case of overages.
* **Manager approval**: The CTM Service Desk will request manager approval for purchase \(even though this is likely no-cost for your department\). 

#### 3. Once approved, the CTM Service Desk will follow up to share instructions to activate your account. 

The pilot platform uses single sign-on \(i.e., your network credentials\), so there is no need to create a new account.
