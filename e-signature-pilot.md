# Access CTM's pilot electronic signature tool

CTM is offering a limited subscription to an electronic signature tool for City departmentsâ€™ use. The pilot tool is part of an existing CTM subscription and is available at likely no-cost to departments. 

Departments are not required to use CTM's pilot platform for electronic signatures. Those that have begun using a platform already can continue to do so, along with reviewing the guidance on this site.

{% hint style="info" %}
In parallel with this pilot phase, CTM is planning for a longer term, citywide signature platform that can serve all departments. Expect more information on this later in 2020.

What to expect when you submit a request:

* **Cost and billing**: Using the pilot tool will likely be no-cost for your department, though we still need to collect your FDU in case of overages. CTM purchased a subscription to this pilot tool that will likely cover most of departments' needs. 
* **Manager approval**: The CTM Service Desk will request manager approval for purchase \(even though this is likely no-cost for your department\). 

#### 3. Once approved, the CTM Service Desk will follow up to share instructions to activate your account. 

The pilot platform uses single sign-on \(i.e., your network credentials\), so there is no need to create a new account.
