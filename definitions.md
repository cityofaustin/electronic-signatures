### Electronic signature

An electronic symbol attached to a contract or other record, used by a person with an intent to sign. There are different types of electronic signatures. This guidance uses the term to mean a basic electronic signature, which: 

* Does not include technology to verify the identity of the person signing.
* Does not detect or protect against changes in the document after the signature.
* Does not give 100% assurance that the signature is created under the sole control of the person signing.

### Digital signature

The most advanced and secure type of electronic signature, which includes cryptographic code to guarantee an electronic document is authentic. Digital signatures include technology that verifies that:

* **The person who signed the message is who they say they are.** Digital signatures use certificate-based Digital IDs linked to the user's identity. The certificates are obtained either from a cloud-based trust service provider or from the signer's local system.  The certificates are difficult to forge because they contain unique encrypted information.  They can be verified using Public Key Infrastructure \(PKI\) technology.
* **The document has not been altered since it was signed.** Digital signatures can provide audit trails that would be useful in case of legal challenges. They log when a document was signed and verify that the document was not changed since signing. 

### Integrity

The ability to verify that document has not been altered since it was signed. Digital signatures are designed to ensure the integrity of signatures, while more basic electronic signatures do not verify changes after signature.

### Audit trail

A listing of activity that shows when and by whom a document has been created, sent, and signed. Audit trails serve as documentation to ensure that the document was not changed after signature. 

### Transaction

In this guidance, we refer to a transaction as the completion of a document or form. Transactions can include applications, request forms, contracts, and change orders. One transaction can include multiple signatures -- for example, a court form that requires signatures from a judge, prosecutor, and defendant.
