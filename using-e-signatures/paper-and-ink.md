# Does law require a paper-and-ink signature?

### Does your transaction involve:

* Wills, codicils, and testamentary trusts 
* Documents relating to adoption, divorce, and other family law matters 
* Court orders, notices, and other court documents such as pleadings or motions \(unless the judge of that court accepts electronic signatures in writing\)
* Notices of cancellation or termination of utility services 
* Notices of default, repossession, foreclosure, or eviction 
* Notices of cancellation or termination of health or life insurance benefits 
* Product recall notices affecting health or safety 
* Documents required by law to accompany the transportation of hazardous materials 
* Someone signing a document that does **not** agree to use electronic signatures
